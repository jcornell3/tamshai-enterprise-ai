      Disable Hermes JS engine to fix TextInput multiline crash.

      The Fabric (New Architecture) + Hermes combination causes access violations
      (0xC0000005) in multiline TextInput due to layout measurement race conditions.
      Chakra is more forgiving with memory access patterns in the hybrid Fabric code.
