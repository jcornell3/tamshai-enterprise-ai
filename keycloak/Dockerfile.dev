# Keycloak for Local Development (tamshai-playground)
# Bakes realm exports into the image to avoid Docker Desktop volume mount issues
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose build keycloak  (rebuilds with latest realm export)
#   docker compose up -d keycloak
#
# Why not volume mount?
#   Docker Desktop on Windows has known issues where mounted files don't reflect
#   changes made after container creation. By copying the file into the image,
#   we ensure `docker compose build --no-cache` always includes the latest config.
